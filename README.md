\[
y_t \approx c + d t \sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i y_{t-i} + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \big(\alpha_k \cos(2\pi k t/s) + \beta_k \sin(2\pi k t/s)\big),
\quad t = N+1,\dots,T,
\]

## Autograding

Please examine the file [grade.m](./scripts/grade.m).
In particular, make sure that an autograder can call \textbf{all functions}
called in this file and that the semantics of all functions is unchanged.
