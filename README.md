# Seasonal Difference-Equation (QR-only) â€” Starter

This repository is a minimal, **QR-only** MATLAB starter for the project
described in this PDF: [main.pdf](./problem/main.pdf)

## Autograding

Please examine the file [grade.m](./scripts/grade.m).
In particular, make sure that an autograder can call \textbf{all functions}
called in this file and that the semantics of all functions is unchanged.
The real autograder will be similar, but it may use different data. Your
code should automatically handle different cities as listed here
